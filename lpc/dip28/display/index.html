<h1>Baremetal programming of the LPC1114/FN28 microcontroller</h1><br>
The LPC1114/FN28 processor is a DIP28 (breadboard friendly) ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller.
It can be programmed using a hardware debug tool that supports Serial Wire Debug.  It can 
also be programmed using a simple USB to serial converter.  This method is called In-System-Programming
(ISP).  It does ,not allow you debug however it is useful nevertheless.  It is certainly very low
cost.  Using this approach it is possible to set up an ARM Cortex development platform for less 
than 10 euros.  <br>
<H2>Driving a seven segment display</H2><br>
<center><img src="display/display.jpg"  height="60%"></center>
This example drives a seven segment display with a count that rolls over at 9999.  Files and documentation
are available <a href=display/display.tar.gz>here</a>.<br>
The toolchain (compiler etc) can be obtained from <a href=https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded>https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded</a>.  This works
for many operating systems.<br>
The software tool that downloads code to your device is called lpc21isp and can be found here <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/>http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpc21isp/</a><br>
If you can't compile this tool (e.g. if you are on a Windows machine) then you might try <a href=http://www.flashmagictool.com/>Flashmagic</a><br>
<H2>Progamming</H2>
The makefile provided with this example creats a file called main.hex (Intel Hex format) which must be downloaded to the microcontroller.  To do this you 
must press the reset and mode buttons (see wiring.pdf) together.  You then release the reset button first followed by the mode button.  The chip
should now be in ISP mode allowing FlashMagic or lpc21isp to download the code to it.  When download is complete press reset once more and the 
program should run.
<H2>More information</H2>
This page will be further edited in time and a number of other examples will be added.  If you need more information contact frank DOT duignan AT dit DOT ie. :)

###LPC111x and LPC8xx Series Cortex-M0+ Arm Processors
> 32-bit Breadboarded processor. mind. blown.

####LPC111x
* What is it?
    * DIP28 Cortex-M0+ Processor
    * 5 ADC (10-bit) inputs (multiplexed)
    
* What it isn't.
    * your senior tech project

* The Internal ADC
    * 5 multiplexed inputs
    * can be clocked a little more than half processor clock (50Mhz with 6% probable error, 12Mhz with 1.5%))

* Input and Output

* Programming
####LPC8xx
* What is it?
    * DIP8 Cortex-M0 Processor

* What it isn't.
    * A magical chip, its got very limited IO

* Input and Output

* Programming
